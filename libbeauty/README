This needs the following package installed:
libbfd-dev

This needs LLVM-3.9 installed.

To see current status do:
In the tree root, do:

./autogen.sh

./configure
make
make install

That will build and install the libs in /usr/local/lib/libbeauty
then:

cd test
make

This will build the test programs dis32, dis64 and bf.

run "./dis64" to see the current working state.
dis64 takes, as input, a .o format file with filename "test.obj" and creates, as output, a .c file "test.c".

The current aim has been changed to the following:
1) Take a x86_64 binary .o file as input.
2) Create an equivalent LLVM IR .o as output.

Once the above works, the aims will be expanded to include:
1) Also support x86_32 binary .o file as input.
2) Also support ARM binary .o file as input.
3) Create .c source code files from the LLVM IR .o file.
4) Implement support for self modifying code.
